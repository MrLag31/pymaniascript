# pymaniascript
`pymaniascript` is a python-only AST builder for Maniascript scripts. This is a POC and is not meant to be used as an API for other programs. This package was made for TM2020 scripts but should be somewhat reliable with Maniaplanet ones.

## Install the package
- First, be sure to have Python installed (Python 3.9 or later is recommended). You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Create a virtual environment if you do not want this package to be installed in your main python.
- Then, clone this very repository:
```
git clone "https://github.com/MrLag31/pymaniascript"
```
- Finally, install this package inside of your python environment.
```
pip install .
```

## Main content
The main package is `pymaniascript.compiler` which is the package that compiles any script given to him. There exists a command line tool that will print the built AST and any errors/warnings the script might have generated. Due to how the game handles included files, the script needed to be compiled must be inside a pre-defined root folder, which is `Scripts` by default.

Another useful package is `pymaniascript.doch` which is handling the `doc.h` file generated by the game. It is not included by default, you will need to generate it yourself. Don't worry, there's a tool for that!

## Usage
These are directly taken from the help page of these scripts.
- `python -m pymaniascript.compiler`
```
usage: 
  python -m pymaniascript.compiler [-h] [-e] [-w] scriptfile

description:
  Computes and prints the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a maniascript script.

positional arguments:
  scriptfile  Path to your script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -e          Also prints errors generated by the AST
  -w          Also prints warnings generated by the AST (forces -e)

Due to how the game handles file includes, the script needed to be compiled must be in a '/Scripts' folder.
When handling big scripts, it is preferable to redirect the output to a file:
  python -m pymaniascript.compiler [-ew] scriptfile > ast
```

- `python -m pymaniascript.doch`
```
usage: 
  python -m pymaniascript.doch [-h] exepath

description:
  Generates the 'doc.h' file from your own game. (The game must not be running)

positional arguments:
  exepath     Path to your 'Trackmania.exe' file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Example
Content of `./Scripts/proc1.Script.txt`:
```
#Include "MathLib" as ML

Vec2 CosSin (Real _Angle) {
    return <ML::Cos(_Angle), ML::Sin(_Angle)>;
}

main () {
    CosSin(5.);
}
```

Content of `ast` after `python -m pymaniascript.compiler -ew .\Scripts\proc1.Script.txt > ast`:

## More information about reports
When using the options `-e` or `-w` with `pymaniascript.compiler`, the compiler will generate the list of reports of the AST. They are seperated into three categories:
- `FATAL_ERROR`: The compiler stumbled on an issue it could not resolve (i.e. syntax errors or file not found).
- `ERROR`: The compiler found an error in the program that will prevent it from compiling within the game.
- `WARNING`: The compiler warns you about something you might have missed (i.e. mispelled names or discarded function results)

From the previous example, the only report is a `WARNING` stating that the returned value of `CosSin` is not used.

## Found a bug?
The correct behaviour should always be the following: every script that compiles with `pymaniascript` (i.e. without `ERROR` reports), should compile within the game and vice-versa. However, there is some known differences that makes it imperfect:
- Due to how `#Include` is handled, trying to find data inside of an uncalled namespace will result in a `FATAL_ERROR`, even within labels.
- There is no order on global definitions, which is not the case in the game.
- The variable `This` is loaded in the current scope only if `#RequireContext` is provided or if `#Extends` is used with another script that has `This`.
- You can declare functions with same signatures.

Thus, please make an issue when you find uncited differences between this compiler and the game's one.
